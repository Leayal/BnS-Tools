# BnS-Tools
## Contents
- BnSDat library (with a "little" edit for more extensive) written in C# (Original work from [RedDot-3ND7355](https://github.com/RedDot-3ND7355/BnS-Buddy) and [LokiReborn](http://www.bladeandsouldojo.com/profile/4070-lokireborn/) and [ronny1982](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bns-tools/files/bnsdat/))
- BnSDat-Automation: a extract/compress tool similiar to [ronny1982's bnsdat tool](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bns-tools/files/bnsdat/) with an addition command...that is `patching`. This tool uses the library above.
- BnSLaunchWrapper: This is a proxy .exe to launch the real client's binary file with additional parameters like `-USEALLCORES` and swapping .xml file and some other convenient functions.
